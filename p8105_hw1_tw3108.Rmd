#Problem 1

This dataset contains NYC weather conditon for JAN 1 - 15.The variables in these data set are `r paste(names(weather))` and I think the key variable is temp: temperature of NYC with a mean of `r mean(weather$temp)`. And time_hour is also important to keep the recording time, and we also have other var for winds and air condition. It has `r nrow(weather)` rows and `r ncol(weather)` coloums total.
